# smartseq3-seurat-pipeline
ðŸ§¬ Pipeline Description
This pipeline provides a complete preprocessing workflow for plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data generated using Smart-seq3. It is built in R using the Seurat package and is intended for researchers working with multi-plate Smart-seq3 data.

The script performs the following steps:

-Loads per-plate data: Raw UMI count matrices (.rds) and barcode mappings.

-Replaces gene IDs with gene symbols using provided annotation files.

-Maps barcodes to well IDs using an index.txt file.

-Aligns gene sets across all plates and merges them into one matrix.

-Creates a single Seurat object combining all plates.

-Integrates metadata from an Excel file (e.g., FACS annotations).

-Performs QC filtering, mitochondrial content analysis, normalization, and dimensionality reduction.

-Clusters cells using PCA and UMAP.

-Subsets cell populations of interest based on metadata annotations.

This script is ideal for projects involving multiple Smart-seq3 plates and provides a foundation for downstream analyses like differential expression or pseudotime.

ðŸ“¥ Input Requirements
This pipeline is designed specifically for plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing methods, such as Smart-seq3.

To run the script successfully, ensure you have the following files for each plate:

ðŸ”¹ Required per-plate files:
-Smartseq3xpress.dgecounts.rds â€” raw count matrix generated by zUMIs

-reads_for_zUMIs.samples.txt â€” barcode-to-sample index file for the plate

These files should be placed inside their respective plate-named folders under data/New_plates/.

Example structure:
data/New_plates/
â”œâ”€â”€ Plate1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Smartseq3xpress.dgecounts.rds
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ reads_for_zUMIs.samples.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ Plate2/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...

ðŸ”¹ Required shared files:
index.txt â€” maps i7/i5 barcode combinations to well IDs

Excel file with metadata.xlsx â€” optional but recommended metadata file

Place these in the root of the data/New_plates/ folder.
